                Did you find any droids? No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned. Send
                a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked. Yes, sir. I sense something...
                a presence I haven't felt since... Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part
                of this ship checked! Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments. I use them for smuggling. I never
                thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never
                get past the tractor beam.

                And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station,
                it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it. The plans you
                refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would
                be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the
                ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!

                Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty
                minutes. This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon
                see the end of the Rebellion.

                Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's
                get out of here! Get away from there... No! wait! Will you forget it? I already tried it.
                It's magnetically sealed! Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed. Absolutely,
                Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here. You know, it's
                not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us. It could be worst... It's worst.
                There's something alive in here! That's your imagination. Something just moves past my leg!
                Look! Did you see that? What? Help!

                Lock the door, Artoo. All right, check that side of the street. It's secure. Move on to the next door.
                I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all the
                trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault. You watch your language!
